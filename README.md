# ☕ Coffee Sales Insights

Welcome to my exploratory data analysis and visualization project on coffee sales  — where Excel meets Tableau and numbers turn into narrative.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data across coffee products, exploring trends by region, category, and timeline. I cleaned and structured the dataset in **Excel**, then brought the insights to life with **interactive dashboards in Tableau**.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Excel** – Data cleaning, transformation, and initial exploration  
- **Tableau** – Interactive dashboards, custom annotations, and geospatial mapping  
- **PowerPoint** – Storyboard summary and presentation slides
